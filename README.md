# The operating system, called JOS, will have Unix-like functions (e.g., fork, exec), but is implemented in an exokernel style (i.e., the Unix functions are implemented mostly in a user-level library instead of in the kernel). 
# The major parts of the JOS operating system are:

1. Booting
2. Memory management
3. User environments
4. Preemptive multitasking

## To run

``` make ```
``` make run-qemu```

## To Quit Quick Emulator (qemu)
``` Press 'CRTL-A' then click on 'x' ```
